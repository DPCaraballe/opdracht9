      <h1>Trevor Bauer loses tough game</h1>

      <p>Trevor Bauer came to Los Angeles to win. The huge contract that the pitcher signed 
        in free agency with the Dodgers made everyone's intentions loud and clear: the Dodgers
        want to repeat. The Dodgers started the season off red-hot, winning 13 out of 15 games and stormed
        out to a big lead in the NL West. And then came the drop-off. The Dodgers went on a 
        free fall, dropping series in San Diego, Chicago, Milwaukee and against the cross-town
        Angels. In those series Bauer took a couple of hard luck losses.
        </p>
        
      <p>The Dodgers co-ace lost another tough game last night, giving up two solo
        home runs to the Houston Astros. The Dodgers offense once again could not
        muster a lot of runs, something that frequently happens when Bauer takes
        the mound. 
      </p>

      <p>Bauer gave up solo homeruns to Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman and exited 
        the game having thrown 100 pitches. The fiery right hander ended with a 
        respectable statline of 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, and 3 strikeouts. The Dodgers'
        winning streak ended at 8. The bullpen gave up 3 more runs after Bauer exited 
        the game, much to the joy of the hostile Houston crowd.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <div class="Bauer">
        Bauer responded to the two big hits: 
      <br>
      <br>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.mlb.com/dodgers/news/dodgers-lose-to-astros-in-finale-of-strong-road-trip">
      “It’s going to happen. I’m not upset about the pitches, they’re just good hitters.
      My fastball plays up in the zone well, and it was up in the zone, and he hit it. 
      Good on him, he’s a good hitter.”
      </blockquote> 
      </div>
      <br>

      <p>The reigning Cy-young winner and ace has been plagued by poor 
        run support in his first year in Los Angeles. Despite sporting a 
        miniscule ERA of 2.07, Bauer already has 3 losses. After throwing 
        126 pitches in his last outing in San Francisco, manager Dave Roberts was 
        not willing to empty the tank on his ace this time.

      <h1>Los Angeles Clippers in deep trouble</h1>

      <p>The Clippers did themselves no favors after last week's debacle which saw
      them lose games deliberately to OKC and Houston. It was all part of a 
      grand master plan to avoid the cross-town Lakers. Instead the Clippers
      got a first round date with a familiar foe, the Dallas Mavericks. 
      And after watching the first two games, it seems that the strategy has 
      backfired. Big time.
      </p>

      <p>Kawhi Leonard had a strong first half, tallying 30 points but was 
        slowed down in the second half, as the Clippers dropped another home 
        game. The Clippers are now staring down the barrel of elimination, as 
        Luka Doncic once again was masterful for the sixth-seeded Dallas
        Mavericks. The Slovenian magician seemed to score at will, as the 
        Clippers threw multiple defenders at him, to no avail. Patrick Beverly,
        Paul George and Marcus Morris all took turns defending the crafty Slovenian,
        who displayed great poise and veteran savvy. 
      </p>

      <p>The Mavericks will head back to Dallas in firm control of the series, 
        leaving the Clippers with little option but to steal home court advantage 
        back, which will be a very tough task. Dallas took two out of three games
        during the regular season, which included a 51-point spanking in the 
        Staples Centre. 
      </p>

      <p>Surprisingly, The Clippers didn't seem fazed at the playoff presser.
         Star player and coach Lue both stressed the fact that the Clippers are 
         not panicking, despite dropping both home games. 

         Fact is that the Clippers have looked tentative, and must find a way 
         to slow down Luka Doncic, who is going bezerk against the L.A outfit. 
         An option could be to put superb wing defender Kawhi Leonard on him.
         Perhaps it's the only viable option left. 
      </p>

      <h1>Lakers even up series with Suns</h1>

      <p>LeBron James is not known for losing games in a row in the playoffs. 
        Period. And it was not about to start. The Lakers shook off the game 1 
        loss to the Phoenix Suns and took game 2 behind two strong performances
        by their superstars LeBron James and Anthony Davis. 
      </p>

      <p>It was a welcome return to form for both players, after both 
        had a sub-par showing in game 1 in the raucious America West Arena. 
        James scored 23 points and Anthony Davis added 34. Dennis Schroder 
        also had a strong showing with 24 points, as the Lakers evened the series
        heading back home. 
      </p>

      <p>Los Angeles took full advantage of the absence of Phoenix 
        floor leader Chris Paul, who injured his shoulder in game 1. Paul 
        was visibly hobbled, and played just 7 minutes in the second half. 
        Devin Booker continued playing well, but was notably less effective 
        than in game 1. The Lakers notably turned on the defensive intensity, 
        and it was enough to escape Arizona with a 1-1 split.
      </p>

      <h1>
        Kershaw back to form
      </h1>

      <p>It's business as usual for Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. He leads the 
        staff in wins (7) and has quality starts in almost all of his outings.
        This season he has firmly implemented the slider as a put away pitch, 
        where in previous season he relied heavily on a 94 mph fastball, and 
        a 12-to-6 curveball.
      </p> 

      <p>Gone are the days where he blew away hitters with the fastball, as it 
        hovers around the 90 mph range nowadays, but the slider has proved to be 
        a very effective strike out pitch for Kershaw, who has really developed 
        a good feel for it. The pitch cuts sharply inside and down for 
        right-handed hitters, looking like a fastball when it leaves Kershaw's 
        hand. The move to use the slider more has paid dividens. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        The awakened bats of Gavin Lux and Max Muncy 
      </h1>

      <p>It didn't have the looks of a break out season for second baseman Gavin Lux. 
        Lux struggled mightily in the early goings of the 2021 season, but has seemed
        to found his stride. The second baseman already has 2 grand slams to his 
        name, on of which he hit in the ballpark of hatred rival San Francisco. 
        The Dodgers have been hit with the injury bug, which has forced Lux to play 
        shortstop in place of injured regular SS Corey Seager. The sceptics were about 
        to have a field day, but Lux clearly had other plans. The Dodgers haven't missed
        a beat since moving Lux to shortstop, as the Los Angeles club creeped back 
        to within a game of rival San Diego. 
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>It was also a rocky start for Max Muncy, who started the season 
        in a serious hitting slump. But the tables have turned, and Muncy is back to his 
        usual self, and has been clearly the Dodgers most consistent hitter in the 
        month of May. Muncy picked up the slack left by the injured CF Cody 
        Bellinger and the drop-off in production by core guys like Mookie Betts.
